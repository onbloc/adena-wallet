**Pull Request Title**

Your pull request title must follow the conventional commits format and start with one of the following types:

- **feat**: A new feature
   - Use this type when you introduce a new feature to the codebase or enhance existing functionality.
   - Example: feat: Add user authentication
- **chore**: Routine tasks or maintenance
   - Use this type when you perform tasks that don't directly change the codebase, such as updating dependencies, configuration changes, or setting up build processes.
   - Example: chore: Update dependencies
- **fix**: A bug fix
   - Use this type when you fix a bug or an issue in the existing codebase.
   - Example: fix: Resolve memory leak issue
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - Use this type when you add new tests to improve code coverage or fix existing tests that were incorrect or failing.
   - Example: test: Add unit tests for user registration
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
   - Use this type when you make changes that only affect the code's appearance, such as whitespace, indentation, or formatting adjustments.
   - Example: style: Apply gofmt to the codebase
- **refactor**: Refactoring code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - Use this type when you restructure existing code to improve its readability, performance, or maintainability without changing its functionality.
   - Example: refactor: Optimize database query logic
   
This will help maintain a clean and consistent commit history and make it easier for other developers to understand the changes made in each commit.
